Part 1 - Bad Sleep
	• 2/3 of adults don’t get recommended 8hrs
	• Averaging less than 6-7 hours of sleep a night increases cancer risk by >50%
	
	• Poor sleep causes Blood sugar dysregulation - chronic sleep loss promotes pre diabetic state and metabolic syndrome
		○ Poor sleep increases appetite - increases ghrelin and decreases Leptin
		○ Increases cortisol which causes premature aging, fat retention and can lead to pain and immune system dysfunction
		○ Dieting doesn’t work if sleep deprived 
			§ A study from the PLOS Medicine journal (2004) found that people who slept less than 7 hours per night were 30% more likely to be obese than those who slept more.
		○ Chronic inflammation is caused by chronic sleep dysfunction
		
	• Sleep disruption contributes to every single psychiatric conditions including depression and suicidality - rely on drugs to get us feeling "normal" when all we needed was good sleep.
		○ Getting less than 7 hours of sleep a night is as detrimental for your brain as staying up for 24 hours straight. Memory and task impairment, like driving, are severely diminished.
				□ Shift workers and pilots have smaller regions of the brain that handle memory and learning
				□ Poor sleep can reduce your ability to learn and remember by 40%
		○ Drowsy driving is just as dangerous as drunk driving - together they are 30x more dangerous than driving well-rested. Drowsy driving kills more than drugs and alcohol related car deaths combined.
		○ Can cause reduction in growth hormone and testosterone causing reduced sex drive, poor recovery, depleted energy and muscular tension.
		
	• Getting less than 7 hours of sleep before getting the flu shot makes it approximately 80% less effective.
		○ Sleep deprivation increases risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.
	• Short sleepers - averaging <7 hours of sleep a night die an average of 10 years sooner than those who sleep between 7 and 8 hours.

2 Questions:
	1. Could you go back to sleep around 10 or 11AM?
		a. Sleep deprived
	2. Could you function normally without caffeine sometime before noon?
		a. Self-medicating sleep deprivation
	
	Short sleepers are just people who get accustomed to functioning poorly.

Part 2 - Good Sleep
		○ Learn, memory
			§ Memory and cognition - up to 40% increase in retention with good night sleep vs staying up all night, this effect is equal to 5 days of <7 hours
			§ Naps are magic
				□ Sleep prior to learning improves our ability to learn new things
					® 20-30% increase in learning with 20-30 minute nap (correlates to increase in sleep spindles) prior to learning
					® Naps significantly 26-36% increase in explicit memory whereas caffeine inhibits this type of memory
		○ Creativity
			§ REM sleep allows for seeking of distant connections and fosters creativity (more later)
	
		○ Emotion
			§ Dreaming helps emotional regulation
			§ According to the National Sleep Foundation, people with insomnia have a ten-fold risk of developing depression compared to those who sleep well.
			
		○ Immune fx
			§  A study published in JAMA (2009) indicated that people who slept less than 7 hours were about three times more likely to develop a cold than those who slept 8 hours or more.
			§ Metabolism & microbiome
				□ 50% more muscle burned <6, 70% more fat burned >8
			
		○ Cardiovascular health
			§ an analysis published in the European Heart Journal (2011) found that sleeping 7-8 hours per night decreased the risk of coronary heart disease by 22% compared to shorter durations.
			§ Research in the European Heart Journal (2019) concluded that sleeping 6-8 hours per night is associated with the lowest risk of heart disease and stroke.
			
		○ Performance
			§ 8 hours of sleep can improve athletic performance by 30-40% vs
			§ Less than 8
				□ 10-30% decreased time to exhaustion
				□ Decreased aerobic output
				□ Decreased strength, throwing speed and jump height
				□ Increased lactate, decreased o2 utilization and increased co2
				□ Decreased thermoregulation
				□ 1.7x increase in injuries with chronically under slept athletes (slide)

Part 3A How sleep works.
Process C vs Process S
Process C and Process S do not communicate or influence each other - they are independent
			
Circadian Rhythm
	• this process refers to the internal body clock that regulates the 24-hour cycle of biological processes.
	• Suprachiasmatic nucleus responsible for rhythm reset. 
	• Sunlight and temperature are the best ways to help your body reset.
	• Melatonin - rises soon after dusk and peaks around 2AM. Should only be used to reset jetlag
	
	
Process S - Homeostatic Sleep Mechanism
	• Adenosine & ATP
	• Ad increases pressure and decreases wakefulness
	Caffeine is a psychoactive chemical - most widely used & abused drug in the world. 
		○ 5-7hrs halflife
		○ cytochrome p4501A2 - enzyme degrades caffeine 
		○ Caffeine degradation is slower as we age
	• Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of a1 and a2a adenosine receptors - also causes increased release of dopamine and nor-epinephrine


Non-Rem(slow-wave sleep) vs REM
Non-REM
	•  During the stages of non-REM sleep, the overall activity of acetylcholine in the brain is lower compared to waking states. This is most pronounced in stages 3 and 4 when sleep spindles are most frequent

	•  Non-REM sleep, particularly slow-wave sleep, is thought to facilitate the consolidation of declarative memories (memories of facts and events). This stage is a replay of neural activity patterns that represent memories being transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage.
	
REM
	•  REM sleep is characterized by a resurgence of acetylcholine to levels that are often comparable to wakefulness. This correlates with a 30% increase of activity in the regions of the brain responsible for learning and memory.
	
	•  REM sleep is hypothesized to play a significant role in the consolidation of procedural memories (skills and tasks). It involves different patterns that suggest a reprocessing and integration of memories, potentially contributing to problem-solving and creative thinking.

Part 3B - Getting good at sleep 
The HITS (Hygiene, Interventions, Tools and Supplements [& drugs])
		a. Hygiene
			1. Schedule
			2. Caffeine
			3. Stress - protect your state of mind as if your life depended on it - because it does
			4. Temperature
				a. Thermostat
				b. Layers
			5. Food and Alcohol
				a. 2 hours before - for different reasons
					a) Alcohol inhibits non-REM sleep and decreases REM sleep
					b) Food increases body temperature and creates circadian irregularity
			6. Light 
				a. Pitch-black
				b. Blackout curtains or eye mask
			7. Noise
				a. Using Sleep Cycle allows you to know if there is ambient noise interrupting your sleep
			8. Routine
				a. 1 hour before bed
			9. Naps 
				a. 20-30 or 90
		
		b. Interventions
				a. Bath, shower or exercise
					a) Bath or shower 2 hours before bed
					b) Exercise ~2hours+ before bed - varies for individual
					
				b. Bedding/Clothing
					a) Silk pillowcase
					b) Socks
				c. Noise
					a) Noise-masking
						i) Noise machine or
						ii)  earbuds - Bose Sleep bud alternatives
					b) Earplugs
				d. Breathing
					a) Sleep Apnea
						i) Must use sleep cycle or have a sleep study
						ii) If you have this you must see an ENT ASAP. Nothing is more important for your health.
					b) Snoring and nasal breathing
						
						1. Nasal breathing enhances the levels of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide, which is produced in the nasal cavity, helps improve the body's ability to absorb oxygen. NO acts as an anti-inflammatory, supports the respiratory tract, and plays a role in repairing lung tissues. Importantly, it aids in increasing arterial oxygen tension and improving blood flow​
						
						2.  The nasal passages filter, humidify, and warm the air before it reaches the lungs. This is beneficial for lung and overall respiratory health, as it reduces the risk of colds, flus, and respiratory infections.
						
						3. : Nasal breathing is associated with more stable sleep patterns. Mouth breathing during sleep, often linked with snoring and sleep apnea, 
						
						4 Enhanced Calmness and Relaxation: Nasal breathing is linked to a more controlled and relaxed breathing pattern, which can have a calming effect on the nervous system. 
						
						5 Dental Health: Chronic mouth breathing can lead to dry mouth, increasing the risk of tooth decay and gum disease. Nasal breathing keeps the mouth closed and maintains healthier oral moisture levels.
						
				e. Insomnia 
					a) CBT
						i) List of steps + supplements
						
		c. Tools
			1. Sleep Trackers
				a. Sleep Cycle
				b. Wearables
				c. Smart Beds

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a structured program that helps you identify and replace thoughts and behaviors that cause or worsen sleep problems with habits that promote sound sleep. Here are the typical steps involved in CBT-I:

1. **Cognitive Restructuring**: This involves identifying and challenging beliefs that affect your ability to sleep. For example, this might involve correcting misconceptions about sleep needs

2. **Stimulus Control Therapy**: This step helps remove factors that condition your mind to resist sleep. For instance, you might be coached to set a consistent bedtime and wake time, use the bed only for sleep and sex, and leave the bedroom if you can't go to sleep within 20 minutes, returning only when you're sleepy.

3. **Sleep Restriction**: Involves limiting the amount of time you spend in bed, causing partial sleep deprivation, which makes you more tired the next night. Once your sleep has improved, your time in bed is gradually increased.

4. **Sleep Hygiene**: This step involves changing basic lifestyle habits that influence sleep, such as smoking and caffeine and alcohol consumption, exercise, and eating habits.

5. **Relaxation Techniques**: Progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback, and breathing exercises are methods used to reduce anxiety at bedtime. These techniques help you control your breathing, heart rate, muscle tension, and mood.

6. **Remaining Passively Awake**: Also known as "paradoxical intention," this involves avoiding any effort to fall asleep. Paradoxically, worrying that you can't sleep can keep you awake. Letting go of this worry can help you relax and make it easier to fall asleep.

7. **Biofeedback**: This method allows you to observe biological signs such as heart rate and muscle tension and shows you how to adjust them. Your therapist may provide you with equipment to monitor these signs at home.

It's important to note that CBT-I is usually a structured program that spans several weeks and is often conducted by a trained therapist. The effectiveness of CBT-I can vary from person to person, and it's often recommended to combine it with other treatments, depending on individual circumstances.
